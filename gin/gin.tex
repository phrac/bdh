Gin\footnote{The name gin is derived from either the French geni√®vre or the
Dutch jenever, which both mean ``juniper''.} is a spirit which derives its
predominant flavor from juniper berries (Juniperus communis). From its earliest
beginnings in the Middle Ages, gin has evolved over the course of a millennium
from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Today,
the gin category is one of the most popular and widely distributed range of
spirits, and is represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavor
profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.\parencite{wiki:gin}
