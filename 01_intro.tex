According to Wikipedia, distillation is ``\emph{a method of separating mixtures
based on differences in volatility of components in a boiling liquid
mixture}''. For the purposes of a beverage distiller, the distiller is
separating ethyl alcohol (or ethanol) from other elements, including
undesirable alcohols and water, to obtain a higher concentration of alcohol
than the base mixture.

The base mixture that the still is charged with, typically called a wash, has a
low concentration of alcohol. The wash is usually produced in much the same way
a beer or wine would be produced, by adding yeast to a fermentable liquid
and waiting until fermentation has completed. Different sugar sources are used
to produce different flavored spirits. For example, if the distiller was
producing a bourbon, his base wash would be at least 51\% corn. Similarly, a
Tequila style drink would be produced from a wash made with sugars primarily
derived from the Blue Agave plant.
