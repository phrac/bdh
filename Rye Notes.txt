Rye mash is fermented on the grain- it is not sparged, or boiled.

Old Protrero recipe:

Mash 100% rye malt at 110F for 30minutes, then 145 (30minutes), then 155
(30minutes) to get the best conversion, then cool with a wort chiller to 80F
and add your yeast. (if you wonder about water chemistry, use the kind for
"California common" styles of beer) The 110F rest is called a "beta-glucan"
rest- it is done to break up the gums in malted and unmalted grain, and in beer
brewing can increase sugar yields by as much as 15%.

Double distilling in a potstill (collect the run in separate lots, say 100ml,
and blend them together by taste) is what is done for Old Protrero (they use an
old fashioned alembic style still- it looks like a onion-topped Cognac still).
It is aged for just about one year in UNCHARRED American oak barrels- he did
this to allow the peppery/honey quality of the rye to come through more
strongly than the vanillins from charred oak, plus, he admits to trying to
replicate an early 1800's whiskey, and charred barrels were not required in
America until 1933- he ("he" being Fritz Maytag- the founder of the distillery,
and founder/owner of the Anchor Steam brewery) is also experimenting with some
new charred oak for his later runs- but I don't think any has been released
